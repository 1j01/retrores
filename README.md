# Retrores
A catalog of cursors and icons from Windows 98, in original and modern formats

## Planned

* Add tons and tons of resources, automate conversion to various formats, and keep JSON metadata which could be considered an API
* An interface for browsing icons and cursors on the web
	* Search (by name and description/tags which can be progressively added, like 
	"Hourglass Hour Glass Sands of Time Waiting Loading Busy Timer Please Wait Progress Standby Stand By")
	* Preview cursors as cursors
	* Download files or copy base64 data URI

## Catalog

There are 3 items in the catalog so far. And the catalog is just a table. Humble beginnings :)

Italics <!-- or *asterisks* if you're reading this as a plain text file --> indicate there was no original title embedded in the cursor.
